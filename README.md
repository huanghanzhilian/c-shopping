## Project Background

![Project Background](https://www.cheerspublishing.com/uploads/article/c1f2d5ba-6fa9-4994-9f9d-c4f49497fd0c.jpeg)

**Background:**
- Traditional front-end UI frameworks have long been constrained by fixed forms (limited by traditional UI frameworks), leading to visual fatigue. When developing highly customized projects, there is often a sense of powerlessness.
- Excellent web projects with multi-device adaptation are rare, with high learning and maintenance costs.
- As projects become complex, dealing with multiple API calls in components can become complicated. For example, managing multiple loading and error states can lead to a declaration of numerous states. Issues like request cancellation and request race conditions are also prone to being overlooked.
- As the project complexity grows, the development and maintenance of styles become extensive and cumbersome.

**Intent:**

Address the issues mentioned in the background.

**Objective:**

Build a complete, well-designed ecosystem suitable for the web.

---

Firstly, let's delve into the technology behind C-Shopping. I have adopted a series of cutting-edge technologies, including Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Headless UI, Redux-Toolkit-RTK Query, JWT, and Docker, among others. This ensures that this project is not only efficient but also highly scalable. We are committed to addressing some pain points of traditional e-commerce platforms: lack of aesthetics, inadequate adaptation to different devices, and a monotonous interface, among others. By adopting the latest technologies and design principles, C-Shopping creates a fully responsive technical development experience for users.

C-Shopping prioritizes user experience. Our interface is not only beautiful but also responsive, allowing users to enjoy shopping easily on any device. The personal center and order management functions also make your shopping experience more personalized and convenient.

## Project Highlights

One of the highlights of C-Shopping is the adoption of a series of advanced technologies, including Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Headless UI, Redux-Toolkit-RTK Query, etc., providing users with an ultimate performance and experience. We not only focus on aesthetics but also strive for excellence in technology.

 **Next.js Driven Lightning-Fast Experience**

C-Shopping uses Next.js, meaning not only is the webpage loading speed incredibly fast, but it also supports server-side rendering, providing an unprecedented level of smoothness.

🎨 **Tailwind CSS Stylish Design**

By using Tailwind CSS, C-Shopping injects a sense of style. Each interface is exquisite, making shopping a visual feast.

🔧 **Headless UI Freedom and Flexibility**

C-Shopping opts for the Headless UI style, giving users more freedom during the shopping process. No longer confined to traditional UI frameworks, it opens more doors for customization.

🔐 **JWT Security Without Worries**

Security is paramount! JWT is used for user authentication, providing the strongest guarantee for your shopping behavior, allowing you to shop with confidence.

🐳 **Docker Perfect Deployment**

C-Shopping embraces Docker, making project deployment incredibly simple. Containerization allows the entire project to run seamlessly in different environments.

🔄 **Redux Toolkit and RTK Query State Management Art**

C-Shopping uses Redux Toolkit and RTK Query, making state management more relaxed and enjoyable. You can better track data flow in the application, ensuring the stability of the shopping experience.

## Deployment and Usage

**Development Environment**

1. Clone or download the repository by running the following command in the terminal:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/huanghanzhilian/c-shopping.git
    ```

2. Install project dependencies using npm or yarn:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

    or

    ```
    yarn
    ```

3. Please create a new `.env` file from `.env.example` file in the project root directory to define the required environment variables. This step is crucial (for image upload to OSS):

    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=<your token secret>
    NEXT_PUBLIC_ALI_REGION=<your ali endpoint>
    NEXT_PUBLIC_ALI_BUCKET_NAME=<your ali bucket name>
    NEXT_PUBLIC_ALI_ACCESS_KEY=<your ali access key>
    NEXT_PUBLIC_ALI_SECRET_KEY=<your ali secret key>
    NEXT_PUBLIC_ALI_ACS_RAM_NAME=<your ali acs:ram name>
    NEXT_PUBLIC_ALI_FILES_PATH=<your ali files pathname>
    ```

4. Install MongoDB on your local machine.

5. Run the project:

    ```
    npm run dev 
    ```

6. Register an account:

    ```
    http://localhost:3000/register
    ```

7. After creating an account, find your account in the database and modify the `root` field to true and the `role` field to admin. This grants you access to all admin dashboard features:
    ```
    mongo
    ```
    ```
    use choiceshop
    ```
    ```
    db.users.update({name:"admin"},{$set:{role:"admin"}})
    db.users.update({name:"admin"},{$set:{root:true}})
    ```

    Administrator entrance: http://localhost:3000/admin

8. In MongoDB, create the root category:

    ```
    mongo
    ```

    ```
    use choiceshop
    ```

    ```
    db.categories.insert({
        "name" : "Featured Items",
        "slug" : "choiceshop",
        "image" : "http://huanghanzhilian-test.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/shop/upload/image//icons/zHle_bmdM_dhu2K938MMM.webp",
        "colors" : {
            "start" : "#EF394E",
            "end" : "#EF3F55"
        },
        "level" : 0
    })
    ```

**Docker Deployment**

The project root directory is already configured with Docker Compose. After installing Docker, simply run the deployment:

```
docker compose up -d --build
```
